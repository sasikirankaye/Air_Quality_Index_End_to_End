# Air_Quality_Index_End_to_End

It is winter time and Air Quality Index of Bangalore is in every newspaper / news channel. So I have colected the data using web scraping technique  for Banglaore which can be used to predict its AQI.
The Dataset contains the climate data of Bangalore on a day-to-day basis from January 1, 2010 to December 31,2018.
This is  an end-to-end project, i.e. from getting data to data wrangling to feature extraction to model creation and then finally deploying it using a Flask webapp.

## step-1.Data collecting using web scraping
## step-2- Cleaning of the data using python
## step-3- Feature engineering
## step-3-Base model building
## step-4 Hyper parameter tuning
## step-5 - Final modle selection(Random forest Regressor)
## step-6- Web deployment using flask frame work
